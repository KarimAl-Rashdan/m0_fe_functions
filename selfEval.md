# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
  If I get stuck on a problem my time management gets messed up. I should submit a question to the group when i get stuck to stay on track.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
  A function is a list of instructions much like a recipe.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
  Parameters are variables in the function. Arguments are the data that takes the place of the variable when ran.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
  I got stuck on the last challenge of functions.js. I'd love to go over that problem.
